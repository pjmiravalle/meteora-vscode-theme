# Meteora

**Meteora** is a refined [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) theme for those who love elegant dark themes that are easy on the eyes.

## Disclaimer

This theme is very much in alpha development, and is expected to not look polished for most programming languages at this time. Proceed with caution!

## Original Theme

Inspired by the original [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme) theme, Meteora brings even further refinement and improvements to your coding experience.
